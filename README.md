# Work-Through: Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming

My work-through[^1]: of the
[Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming book](https://learnopengl.com/book/book_pdf.pdf)
by Joey de Vries.

[^1]: My practice of working through examples, books, tutorials, etc., to keep up with the
    software industry and continuously improve my skills and knowledge.

The key difference between what I've done in this repo and what is described in
the book is I've used the [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system.

## Additions

Some additional work has been done aside from working through the examples in
the book. All of the info in this README applies to the additonal examples
unless otherwise noted.

## Building

TODO

## Notes

Notes, tips, and tricks.
